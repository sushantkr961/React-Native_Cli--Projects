In Windows 11, pinning the Recycle Bin directly to the taskbar is not currently supported. However, you can create a shortcut to the Recycle Bin on the taskbar by following these steps:

Right-click on an empty space on the desktop.

From the context menu, go to "New" and select "Shortcut."

In the "Create Shortcut" window, enter the following path for the location of the item:
explorer.exe shell:RecycleBinFolder

Click "Next."

Provide a name for the shortcut, such as "Recycle Bin," and click "Finish."

A shortcut to the Recycle Bin will be created on your desktop.

Now, right-click on the Recycle Bin shortcut on your desktop.

From the context menu, select "Pin to Taskbar."


If you want to access the Recycle Bin icon specifically in the "Change Icon" option, you can follow these steps:

Open File Explorer by pressing the Windows key + E on your keyboard or by clicking on the File Explorer icon in the taskbar.

In the File Explorer address bar, copy and paste the following path:
%SystemRoot%\System32\imageres.dll

Press Enter to navigate to the specified location.

In the "imageres.dll" file, you'll find a wide range of system icons.

Scroll through the icons until you find the Recycle Bin icon(s). Typically, you'll find multiple Recycle Bin icons with different variations.

Once you locate the Recycle Bin icon you prefer, note the index number associated with it.

In the "Change Icon" window for your shortcut (following the previous instructions), click on the "Browse" button.

In the "Browse" window, paste the following path into the address bar:
%SystemRoot%\System32\imageres.dll

Press Enter to navigate to the specified location.

Select the "imageres.dll" file and click "Open."

In the "Change Icon" window, you'll now see a list of icons available within the "imageres.dll" file.

Use the scroll bar to find the index number associated with the desired Recycle Bin icon you noted earlier.

Select the icon and click "OK."

The icon for your shortcut will be updated to the chosen Recycle Bin icon from the "imageres.dll" file.


If you want to create a shortcut to the "This PC" (formerly known as "My Computer") instead of the Recycle Bin, you can follow these steps:

Right-click on an empty space on your desktop.
Select "New" from the context menu, and then choose "Shortcut."
In the "Create Shortcut" window, enter the following path for the location of the item:
explorer.exe shell:ThisPCFolder
Click "Next."
Provide a name for the shortcut, such as "This PC," and click "Finish."
The shortcut to "This PC" will be created on your desktop.
You can then right-click on the shortcut and select "Pin to Taskbar" to add it to the taskbar.
This will allow you to have quick access to the "This PC" view from the taskbar.
